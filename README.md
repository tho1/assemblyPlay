### Assembly playground
This repository is a test of different assembly codes I found online.  The code are built using nasm and fasm. Would be interested to learn others available. I would be interested to learn pros and cons.  

#### Gotchas
* Mac OS X only support AT&T syntax
* Windows prefer Intel syntax  

### Tools and one liner
objdump -d -M intel ./yourbinary
